    <h1>Pilestredet Campus</h1>
    <p>A university is nothing without a place to be, <em>the campus</em>. At <strong>Oslomet</strong> there are several campuses, 
        but not such as good as pilestredet.

    <h2>Oslomets discription of the campus</h2> 
    <p>
        Welcome to Norway’s most urban university campus.
        Our Pilestredet campus is surrounded by cafes for reading or meeting friends 
        and restaurants where you can buy lunch at student-friendly prices. 
        All the main attractions of downtown Oslo—including shopping, parks, 
        bars and the Oslo fjord—are just a short walk or tram ride away. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Like many urban campuses, Pilestredet is compact. You can walk from one end of campus to the other in about ten minutes. 
        There is plenty of architecture to admire along the way, 
        from old brick buildings—the northern part of campus is located on the grounds of
        a brewery that opened in the 1850s—to modern, 
        glass buildings that remind you that you’re in Scandinavia. 
        All across campus, you will find 
        <a href="https://sio.no/mat-og-drikke/vare-spisesteder-og-kaffebarer?campus=OsloMet">cafeterias</a>, 
        <a href="https://www.oslomet.no/en/ul">libraries</a>, 
        <a href="https://www.samfunnetbislet.no/">student pubs</a>,

    </p>

    <p>
        At Pilestredet, you find the Student Centre and the Service Centre. 
        Our main reception is located in Pilestredet 46 and the Student Centre is located in Pilestredet 52.

    <h2>History of the campus and OsloMet</h2>
    <p>The campus is built on a site that was the home of the brewevery frydenlund. This brewery no longer operates and
        has been absored by another company. The following is a short description of the history of the brewery.
    </p>

    <h3>Fryndenlund Brewery</h3>

    <p>
        Frydenlund Brewery was a former Norwegian brewery, located in Oslo, which was founded in 1859. 
        Frydenlund was in its time one of the country's largest breweries.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ship captain Mads Ellef Langaard from Lillesand founded the company in Oslo (then Christiania), 
        and the name Frydenlund originates from the loop at Pilestredet 52 where the production premises were built. 
        The brewery's trademark was a six-pointed star, with the founder's initials inside. 
        This brand became Norway's first protected trademark, 
        when it was registered in 1884. The trademark is still in use on Frydenlund beer.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1886, Norway's first brewery laboratory was built at Frydenlund Brewery.
    </p>
    <p>
        The brewery transport was easily recognizable because of the horses. 
        Frydenlund Bryggeri only used black døla horses as brewing horses, 
        and the color black was also used on the beer crates that they delivered to the outlets.
        When the horses were replaced by cars in the 1950s, these were also painted black.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1962, the brewery entered as a subsidiary of De samsklittede bryggerier, together with Schous Bryggeri. 
        In 1977, the two companies merged to form Frydenlund Schous Bryggeri, 
        and the following year they were acquired by Nora Industrier, who also owned Ringnes Bryggeri.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rationalization and efficiency were necessary in the brewing industry, and since the group here had several breweries, 
        it was necessary to look at the structuring. 
        This led to Schous Bryggeri ceasing to be an independent production company in 1981, 
        and two years later the remaining two breweries were merged into Frydenlund Ringnes Bryggerier. 
        Five years later, this became Ringnes AS.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Orkla group took over Nora Industrier in 1991, and in 1995 Frydenlund Bryggeri suffered the same fate as Schous,
        and production in its own premises ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
        Frydenlund beer can still be bought, but production now takes place at Ringnes Bryggeri, 
        which from 2004 became part of the Danish Carlsberg.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some of the buildings in which Frydenlund Bryggeri produced have been demolished, 
        but the remaining ones today belong to OsloMet - the metropolitan university.
